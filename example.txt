Hey lets commit your efforts
untracked changes-Working Directory

to send files in working in working directory they should be saved in local.
if we want to send only example.txt then we can not do using staging area


from working directory to staging we can select what we need to send but staging to local we need to send all 




Working directory            |              staging area         |            Local Repository      | Remote Repository

local to remote:git push
Staging to local command is git commit
Working to Staging is git add


some changes here as well

changes from staging
